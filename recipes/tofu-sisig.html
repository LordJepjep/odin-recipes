    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves sisig. Of all the sizzling plate dishes, I would argue that sisig is one of the best. This Kapampangan native makes use of all the pig parts you usually set aside. The result? Something extremely addictive! Sisig has grown in popularity over the years — and across the country, too! An absolute staple at restobars around the country, sisig has earned its spot in the Filipino Food Hall of Fame. But eating all that juicy pork can often come with a price — usually aimed at your health. Thankfully, this sizzling tofu sisig is a crispy, addictive, vegetarian way of enjoying one of your favorite dishes!</p>
