    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>According to several experts in Asian food history, Filipinos were cooking adobo before Spanish colonization. Cooking with vinegar preserves meat, and is one of the earliest food preservation practices. This is also true of pork adobo, which is another popular variation of the dish.</p>
    <p>While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, chicken adobo remains one of the most popular and for good reason! The taste of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce makes chicken adobo a comfort food for all ages. From kids to adults, we canâ€™t get enough of this mouthwatering meal!</p>
